# F53OSC

Hey neat, it's a nice open source OSC library for Objective-C.

From your friends at [Figure 53](http://figure53.com).

For convenience, we've included a few public domain source files from [CocoaAsyncSocket](https://github.com/robbiehanson/CocoaAsyncSocket).  But appropriate thanks, kudos, and curiosity about that code should be directed to [the source](https://github.com/robbiehanson/CocoaAsyncSocket).

## Usage Notes

- F53OSC must be compiled with ARC.
- You must link against Security.framework and CFNetwork.framework.
- F53OSC requires macOS 10.9+ or iOS 7.0+.

## Demo

Inluded is a small demo app "F53OSC Monitor", which logs OSC messages sent to it via port 9999 and displays some basic stats about incoming traffic.
